# FinalProject-Cat-Toy

### Main idea: An autonomous cat toy designed to simulate the behavior of a living prey that "watches" its surroundings. The system stays in a low-power "lookout" mode, using a rotating sensor to detect presence without needing to move the entire mechanical arm. Instead of just spinning aimlessly, it remains still until it senses an interaction, at which point it "comes to life" with randomized, reactive movements to keep the cat engaged and prevent the toy from becoming predictable
